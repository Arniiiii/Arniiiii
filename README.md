## Who am I
Just a guy from Ukraine that knows some C++, Python and CMake.

## My public activity
1. Writing ebuilds for Portage package manager. Check [ex_repo](https://github.com/Arniiiii/ex_repo)
2. Helping some random guys at [C++](https://discord.gg/tccpp) and [Gentoo](https://discord.gg/gentoolinux) discord channels
3. Reporting bugs to [bugs.gentoo.org](https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?email2=lg3dx6fd%40gmail.com&emailassigned_to2=1&emailcc2=1&emaillongdesc2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailtype2=substring&order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cpriority%2Cbug_severity&query_format=advanced&resolution=---&resolution=FIXED&resolution=INVALID&resolution=WONTFIX&resolution=LATER&resolution=REMIND&resolution=DUPLICATE&resolution=WORKSFORME&resolution=CANTFIX&resolution=NEEDINFO&resolution=TEST-REQUEST&resolution=UPSTREAM&resolution=OBSOLETE&resolution=PKGREMOVED)
4. Making some CMake-based projects easy to add, find, use and install correctly. Sometimes fix CI.
5. Making some mediocre projects either for:
    - [x] university
    - [x] as a test "job" for a job
